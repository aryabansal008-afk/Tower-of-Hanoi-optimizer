# Tower of Hanoi â€“ Shortest Permutation Solver

A C program to find the shortest sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.  
This project demonstrates the use of **recursion** and algorithmic problem-solving to efficiently solve the puzzle.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Calculates the minimal number of moves to solve Tower of Hanoi.
- Generates the **optimal sequence of moves** step by step.
- Demonstrates recursive algorithm implementation in C.
- Beginner-friendly, with clear and structured code.

## ðŸ§© How It Works
- The program takes the number of disks as input.
- Recursively moves disks from the source peg to the destination peg using an auxiliary peg.
- Follows the standard rules:  
  1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.  
  2. No larger disk can be placed on a smaller disk.  
- Prints each move, ensuring the shortest sequence of steps.
